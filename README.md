# Fractional Biprime Factorization

This project presents the **Fractional Biprime Factorization Method**, a novel approach to factoring biprime numbers (numbers with exactly two prime factors) using guided fractional divisions.

## 🔍 Description

The method is based on the insight that dividing a biprime number `O` by special decimal fractions such as `X.25` or `X.75` can yield a quotient whose division by a power of 2 gives back one of the prime factors. This technique has been tested successfully up to `10^8`.
